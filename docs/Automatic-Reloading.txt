Get Outside! has a facility allowing you to run certain tasks on a schedule, most
notably the automatic reloading of Place and/or Event data sources so you don't need
to reload them yourself via the admin panel every day.

Important: Scheduling Access

To use this, you MUST have access to the scheduled task system on your server. This is highly
dependent on your own system, and you will want to consult your web host's documentation and/or technical
support. A few well-known support pages are here for your convenience.

    Plesk, e.g. GoDaddy:

    DreamHost:

    Cron, on Linux / Ubuntu:

What To Execute

The task to be executed, depends on whether you want to reload Events or Places.

    To reload Events, execute this task:
        cd /maps/knight/getoutside/stpaul2
        php index.php cronjobs reload_events

    To reload Places, execute this task:
        cd /maps/knight/getoutside/stpaul2
        php index.php cronjobs reload_places

How often you need to reload, is really up to you. Consider these points:

    - A reload will revisit every Place or Event data source, and could take
        several minutes. It may generate significant web traffic as it downloads
        spreadsheet data or queries WFS services, and may generate server load in
        the form of database work.

    - During a reload, there's a transitional state while the contents are still
        loading. If it takes 3 minutes to reload the events calendar, and you do
        this every hour, then you increase the chance that somebody will happen
        to visit during the moment when the event calendar is still being refilled.

    - Do you really have Events changing so quickly that you need to reload every
        hour? Do you really need to update Places every single day, or can you live
        with a brand-new park not showing up for a whole day (given that it took
        six months for it to be finalized and pushed into the data source)?
