Do you have Places or Events in some other format which isn't supported by the
existing PlaceDataSource or EventDataSource driver subclasses? Then feel free
to write it! Here's a guide to get you started.


GETTING STARTED

Check out the base class for these data sources. There are some lengthy comments describing
how to subclass it into a driver:
    models/placedatasource.php
    models/eventdatasource.php

You can crib from the existing drivers, that's a great way to get a start. Customize the _$option_fields_, then
the functions described in _INSTANCE METHODS_ and you should be 90% there.


SECURITY / VALIDATION

Keep in mind that the URL field and the _option_ fields are user-supplied, usually using the admin UI but
hypothetically using plain old UPDATE statements in the DB and bypassing the UI. _As such, the url and option fields
should be treated as untrustworthy input_ or at least no more trustworthy than an admin who accidentally enters
an URL incorrectly. At least check that the URLs look right so you don't confuse the end users by letting
them try to load URLs that don't even make sense.

If you allow just any URL to be used with any supplied options, a "rogue datasource" could be used to send garbage
requests to other websites, and could hypothetically be used to attack other websites. For some drivers there
may be little you can do about this, and then again a site admin installing this software surely has other means
to accomplish that.

Please follow the usal common sense for such things:
* reloadContent() and listFields() should check the URL for proper formatting, e.g. starts with _http_, has the right file extension, trimming off query params and constructing them yourself, and so on.
* Implement extensive checking of the file content: starts with the "<?xml" header, has a "title" field, etc. If the file doesn't open properly, or doesn't look right, bail!


EVENT LOCATIONS

Places are locations, and Events are times, and the two do not meet.

However, some Event data sources support location information (Active.com) creating the concept of EventLocations. This is not the same thing as Places, so don't even think about it.

If your driver supports EventLocations, write that into the reloadContent() function. The suggested mechanism is described in the EventLocations document, and you may also want to refer to the Classes.txt as a refresher on the class hierarchy.
