/**
 * Decodes a polyline that was encoded using the Google Maps method.
 *
 * The encoding algorithm is detailed here:
 * http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/polylinealgorithm.html
 *
 * This function is based off of Mark McClure's JavaScript polyline decoder
 * (http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/EncodePolyline/decode.js)
 * which was in turn based off Google's own implementation.
 *
 * This function assumes a validly encoded polyline.  The behaviour of this
 * function is not specified when an invalid expression is supplied.
 *
 * @param String $encoded the encoded polyline.
 * @return Array an Nx2 array with the first element of each entry containing
 *  the latitude and the second containing the longitude of the
 *  corresponding point.
